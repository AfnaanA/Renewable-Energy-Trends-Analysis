# Renewable Energy Trends Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes trends in renewable energy production over the last decade, with a focus on solar and wind energy. The analysis evaluates the growth potential of different renewable energy sources, comparing them across various regions and countries, and examining the influence of governmental policies where possible.

## Objectives
- Evaluate the trends and growth potential of renewable energy sources over the past decade.
- Identify which renewable energy sources (solar, wind, hydro, bioenergy) are expanding the fastest.
- Determine which regions or countries have seen the most significant increases in solar and wind energy production.
- Explore the correlation between renewable energy growth and government incentives or policies in these regions.

## Central Hypothesis
Solar and wind energy have shown the most significant growth among renewable energy sources over the past decade.

## Key Questions
1. What are the growth trends for solar and wind energy compared to other renewable sources like hydro and bioenergy over the past decade?
2. Which regions or countries have seen the most significant increase in solar and wind energy production?
3. What is the correlation between renewable energy growth and government incentives or policies in these regions?

## Dataset
The analysis is based on data from the Global Power Plant Database, which includes information on approximately 35,000 power plants across 167 countries. Key attributes in the dataset include:
- Country
- Name and ID of the power plant
- Capacity in megawatts (MW)
- Primary fuel type
- Yearly generation data from 2013 to 2019

  
## Results and Conclusion
The analysis confirms that solar and wind energies are the fastest-growing renewable energy sources globally. Regions like Europe and North America are leading in adopting these technologies, likely influenced by supportive government policies. The findings are crucial for stakeholders in making informed decisions about future investments in renewable energy.
